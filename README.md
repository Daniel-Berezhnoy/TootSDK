## What is this? üôã‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

TootSDK is a framework for Mastodon and the Fediverse, for iOS. It provides a toolkit for authorizing a user with an instance, and interacting with their posts.

TootSDK is a community developed SDK for Mastodon and the Fediverse.
It is designed to work with all major servers (Mastodon, Pleroma, PixelFed etc).

You can use TootSDK to build a client for Apple operating systems, or on linux via Vapor.

## Getting started üèÅ

You can add TootSDK to your project via Swift Package Manager:
`https://github.com/kkostov/TootSDK`

Check out our example iOS project `TootSDK-iOS-Demo` in the Examples directory. This provides an example application using SwiftUI and TootSDK to browse a feed and create posts.
