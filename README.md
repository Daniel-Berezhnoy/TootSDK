## What is this? üôã‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

TootSDK is a framework for Mastodon and the Fediverse, for iOS. It provides a toolkit for authorizing a user with an instance, and interacting with their posts.

TootSDK is a community developed SDK for Mastodon and the Fediverse.
It is designed to work with all major servers (Mastodon, Pleroma, PixelFed etc).

You can use TootSDK to build a client for Apple operating systems, or Linux with Vapor.

### Status

- Mastodon - In progress
- Pleroma - In progress
- Pixelfed - To do
- Writefreely - To do

Please don't hesitate to open an Issue or a PR if you are missing an endpoint or would like to improve support for existing or other servers üôè!

## Getting started üèÅ

You can add TootSDK to your project via Swift Package Manager:
`https://github.com/TootSDK/TootSDK`

Check out our example iOS project `TootSDK-iOS-Demo` in the Examples directory. This provides an example application using SwiftUI and TootSDK to browse a feed and create posts.

You can also peek at `vaportoot` - an example for a server-side implementation using Vapor.

To get started, you need an instance of `TootClient`.

### Authentication

If you need to authorize the user, we provide several methods to help with the process.

- Step 1, navigate to the authorization url of the user's instance.

```swift
let client = TootClient(instanceURL: instanceURL)
let authUrl = client.createAuthorizeURL(server: instanceURL, callbackUrl: "swiftuitoot://test")
```

- Step 2, once authentication is complete, the server will redirect the user back to callback url including a token

```swift
let accessToken = client.collectToken(callbackUrl: url)
```

We recommend keeping the accessToken somewhere secure, for example Keychain.

Once you have an access token and the url to the user's server:

```swift
let client = TootClient(instanceURL: instanceURL, accessToken: accessToken)
...
for await updatedPosts in try await client.data.stream(.timeLineHome) {
    print("got a batch of posts \(updatedPosts)")
}
```

üí° For testing (even in your own apps), you can use `Examples/swiftyadmin` with the `login` command to generate an accessToken for a given instance.

## Examples

We have prepared several examples that demonstrate how to use TootSDK in your projects.
They are all located in the `Examples` folder of the repository.

### Using TootSDK with SwiftUI

The SwiftUI-Toot app showcases usage of the framework in a SwiftUI app.

### Using TootSDK with Vapor

`$ cd ./Examples/vaportoot`
`vapor run`

- Navigate to `localhost:8080` in your browser and fill in the url of a fedi server to connect with.

- We've added examples for making a post, viewing the timeline and interacting with posts (like reply and repost).
