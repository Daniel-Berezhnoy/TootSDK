# TootSDK Road map üó∫Ô∏è

All good things take time to build.
We figured that it was best to release TootSDK at a base level of operation  and then keep enhancing from there.

If you see anything in our future road map that is particularly important to you, then we encourage you to look at our [contribution guide](./CONTRIBUTING.md) and submit us a PR! ü§ù

## Version 0.1 ‚úÖ
- Authorization calls and ability to return the access token to the parent app for safe storage in the keychain etc
- All post calls
    - Publishing, Editing, Deleting
    - Mute/unmute conversations
    - Pin/Unpin posts
    - Boosting, Favouriting, Bookmarking
    - Get parent and child posts in context
